Extract-Specific-Log-Info-V1.1
Small automation Python script- Extract specific log information. Under macOS, Linux OS. 
Count occurrences of keywords, get the timestamp for specific occurrences of keywords, get the elapsed time of specific log entries.

Take some time and wrote a small automated program in Python that can automatically extract two keyword and elapsed time from log. It should be executable. BTW, but if the time format in the log text is changed, the execution will be a bit problematic! 
I will modify it later when I am free!
